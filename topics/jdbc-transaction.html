        <h2>What is Transaction Management?</h2>
        <p>Transaction management is a process that ensures data consistency, reliability, and integrity when multiple operations are performed as part of a single logical unit of work.</p>
        <p>A transaction in a database is a sequence of operations performed as a single unit that must either completely succeed or completely fail.</p>

        <h2>Need for Transaction Management</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensures data consistency across multiple operations.</li>
          <li>Prevents data corruption during concurrent access.</li>
          <li>Supports rollback in case of errors or failures.</li>
          <li>Maintains the integrity of the database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ACID Properties</h2>
        <p>ACID properties ensure reliable processing of transactions in a database:</p>

        <h2>JDBC Transaction Management Example</h2>
        <p>JDBC allows transaction management by default. The auto-commit mode is enabled, meaning every SQL statement is treated as a transaction. To manage transactions manually:</p>
        <pre><code>
    import java.sql.Connection;
    import java.sql.DriverManager;
    import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
    import java.sql.SQLException;
    
    public class TransactionManagementExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
            String user = "root";
            String password = "password";
    
            String insertAccount1 = "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1";
            String insertAccount2 = "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2";
    
            try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
                // Disable auto-commit mode
                connection.setAutoCommit(false);
    
                try (PreparedStatement stmt1 = connection.prepareStatement(insertAccount1);
                     PreparedStatement stmt2 = connection.prepareStatement(insertAccount2)) {
    
                    stmt1.executeUpdate();
                    stmt2.executeUpdate();
    
                    // Commit the transaction
                    connection.commit();
                    System.out.println("Transaction committed successfully.");
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    // Rollback the transaction in case of errors
                    connection.rollback();
                    System.err.println("Transaction rolled back due to an error: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
